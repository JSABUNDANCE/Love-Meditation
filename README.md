For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Build on line short courses.

## Testing 

I have the done the testing and the site works well. 3 pages are all working as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to obtain the information about the love meditation group.

All 3 pages look and work on different browsers and screen sizes including mobile and tablet.



### Validator Testing

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

I have gone through the process to deploy the project to a hosting platform as github.
